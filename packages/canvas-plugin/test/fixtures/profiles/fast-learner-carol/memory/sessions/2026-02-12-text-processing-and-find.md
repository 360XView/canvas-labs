# Session: Text Processing + Find Files
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Duration:** ~30min (both labs)
**Outcome:** Both completed

## What Happened
Carol completed text-processing and find-files in one session. Used 1 hint on find -exec
syntax (understandable — it's unusual). Otherwise flawless.

## Observations
- Text processing: sort, uniq, wc all intuitive. Built complex pipelines without guidance.
- Find: understood the concept but -exec syntax tripped her up (the {} \; pattern).
  After one hint, used it correctly for the rest of the session.
- Asked about xargs as an alternative to -exec — showing curiosity beyond the curriculum.

## What Worked
- Optimization challenges kept her engaged ("do it in fewer commands").
- Answering her xargs question and letting her try both approaches.

## Flags
- Ready for capstone or advanced material. Regular curriculum may be too slow.
