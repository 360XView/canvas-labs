# Session: Shell Navigation + File Operations
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Duration:** ~25min (both labs)
**Outcome:** Both completed

## What Happened
Carol completed both shell-navigation and file-operations in a single session. Zero hints
on either lab. Finished navigation in 8 minutes, immediately asked for the next challenge.

## Observations
- Prior experience is evident — knew cd, ls, cat, grep before starting.
- Pipes and redirect: understood immediately ("oh, like stdout piping in Python").
- Completed file-operations exercises then asked "is there a harder version?"
- Skipped reading introductions entirely — jumped straight to tasks.

## What Worked
- Letting her speed through without unnecessary explanation.
- Offering bonus challenges ("can you find all .log files modified today in one command?").

## Flags
- May need conceptual depth checks — doing it right ≠ understanding why.
