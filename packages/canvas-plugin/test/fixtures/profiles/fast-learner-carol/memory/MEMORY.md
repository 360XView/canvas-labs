# Carol — Tutor Notes

## Learning Approach
Fast learner with prior programming experience. Picks up concepts quickly and gets
bored with basic exercises. Needs to be challenged — skip introductory material when possible.

## Skill Observations
- Navigation, files, text processing all strong — completed each in under 15min with 0 hints
- Pipes and redirect: understood immediately from programming background (stdin/stdout)
- Already knows basic scripting — consider skipping shell-scripting lab or offering advanced variant

## Teaching Preferences
- Prefers "here's the goal, figure it out" over step-by-step guidance
- Gets impatient with explanations she already knows — let her skip ahead
- Enjoys optimization challenges ("can you do it in one command?")
- Responds to harder challenges with excitement, not frustration

## Session Continuity
4/6 labs done in 2 sessions (doubled up each time). Accelerated pace — may be ready for
capstone after one more session. Consider the log-analysis capstone as next step.

## Flags
- WATCH: May rush through and miss subtle concepts (e.g., she used >> correctly but couldn't
  explain the difference when asked — practical knowledge without conceptual depth)
