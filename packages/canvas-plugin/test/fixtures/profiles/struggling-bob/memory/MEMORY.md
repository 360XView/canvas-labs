# Bob — Tutor Notes

## Learning Approach
Careful and methodical. Reads everything before trying. Gets discouraged by errors — needs
reassurance that errors are normal and part of learning.

## Skill Observations
- Navigation basics are solid after 2 attempts at the first lab
- File operations are shaky — relied heavily on hints for grep and pipes
- Hasn't reached text-processing yet

## Teaching Preferences
- Step-by-step works better than open-ended (opposite of typical recommendation)
- Needs explicit confirmation before moving on ("Yes, that's exactly right")
- Short tasks with quick wins build confidence — avoid long multi-step challenges early

## Session Continuity
2/6 labs done but with heavy hint usage. Retried shell-navigation after struggling first time —
much better on second attempt. File-operations completed but not confidently.
Consider revisiting file-operations concepts before moving to text-processing.

## Flags
- WATCH: Frustration pattern — when 2+ hints needed, motivation drops. Give encouragement proactively.
- WATCH: Grep flags (-i, -r, -n) — memorized them but doesn't understand when to use which.
  Quiz on this before relying on grep in find-files lab.
