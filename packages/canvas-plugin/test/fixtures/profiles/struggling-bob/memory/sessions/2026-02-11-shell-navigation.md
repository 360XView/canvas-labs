# Session: Shell Navigation (Retry)
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Duration:** ~30min
**Outcome:** Completed

## What Happened
Bob retried shell-navigation after struggling on first attempt. Much improved — completed
all tasks with only 1 hint (vs 5 on first attempt).

## Observations
- More confident this time — knew what to expect.
- Still hesitates before each command, but executes correctly.
- Asked "is this right?" before pressing Enter on 3 commands.

## What Worked
- Starting with "you already know more than you think" encouragement.
- Explicit confirmation after each correct step.

## Flags
- Confidence is still fragile — needs proactive encouragement.
