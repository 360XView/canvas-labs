# Session: Shell File Operations
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Duration:** ~35min
**Outcome:** Completed

## What Happened
Bob completed file-operations but relied heavily on hints (4 total). Grep flags and
pipe syntax were the main struggle points.

## Observations
- Cat and basic file viewing: solid, no issues.
- Grep: understands the concept but gets confused by flags. Used -i when he meant -r.
- Pipes: needed 2 hints to understand the flow direction.
- Completed all tasks but confidence is low.

## What Worked
- Breaking pipe commands into "what goes in" and "what comes out" for each stage.
- Written examples he could reference.

## Flags
- WATCH: Grep flag confusion persists — may need a reference card approach.
- WATCH: Motivation dipped after the second hint on pipes.
