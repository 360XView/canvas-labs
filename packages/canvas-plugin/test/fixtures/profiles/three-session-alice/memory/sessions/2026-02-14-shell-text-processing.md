# Session: Shell Text Processing
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Duration:** ~22min
**Outcome:** Completed

## What Happened
Alice completed text-processing. Sort and uniq came easily. Pipelines took two attempts
on the build-pipeline task but she worked it out herself. Redirect demo at start worked.

## Observations
- Side-by-side redirect demo at session start worked — used >> correctly throughout.
- Sort/uniq: intuitive, no issues.
- Pipelines: built a 4-command pipeline on second attempt after rethinking the order.

## What Worked
- Concrete side-by-side demo for redirect (instead of analogy).
- Open-ended challenge format for the pipeline task.

## Flags
- None — redirect issue resolved.
