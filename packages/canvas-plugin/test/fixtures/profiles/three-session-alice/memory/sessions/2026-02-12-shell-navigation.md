# Session: Shell Navigation
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Duration:** ~18min
**Outcome:** Completed

## What Happened
Alice completed the shell-navigation lab on her first attempt. Fast on absolute paths and
ls, needed hints for relative path shortcuts (.. and ~).

## Observations
- Jumps into tasks immediately — explorer type.
- Strong on absolute paths — no hesitation.
- Relative paths tripped her up — used 2 hints on `..`.

## What Worked
- Letting her try first before explaining.

## Flags
- WATCH: Relative path shortcuts (.. and ~) — check in file-operations.
