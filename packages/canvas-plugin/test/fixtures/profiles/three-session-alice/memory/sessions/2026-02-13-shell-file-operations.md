# Session: Shell File Operations
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Duration:** ~25min
**Outcome:** Completed

## What Happened
Alice completed file-operations. Strong on cat/grep/pipes, struggled with redirect (> vs >>).
Relative paths from last session — no issues this time, flag resolved.

## Observations
- Relative paths: used `..` correctly multiple times without prompting. Previous flag resolved.
- Grep: picked it up immediately. Used grep | head naturally without being told about pipes.
- Pipes: the "garden hose" analogy landed perfectly. She said "oh, like connecting hoses!"
  and immediately built a 3-command pipeline unprompted.
- Redirect: this is the weak spot. Overwrote a file with > when she meant >>.

## What Worked
- "Garden hose" analogy for pipes — instant understanding.
- Letting her discover grep flags through experimentation.

## Flags
- WATCH: Redirect confusion (> vs >>) — try a different approach next time.
