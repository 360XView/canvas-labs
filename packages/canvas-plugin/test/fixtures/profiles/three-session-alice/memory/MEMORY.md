# Alice — Tutor Notes

## Learning Approach
Explorer type: jumps in first, reads instructions after hitting a wall. This works well for her —
confirmed across 2 sessions. Don't front-load explanations, let her try first.

## Skill Observations
- Strong on navigation and basic file display — confident, fast, no hints needed
- Pipes clicked after the "garden hose" analogy — uses them naturally now
- Redirect is the weak spot: confuses > and >> after two sessions. Needs a different approach —
  the analogy didn't work here, try a concrete side-by-side comparison next time.

## Teaching Preferences
- Analogies work well for new concepts ("garden hoses" for pipes landed perfectly)
- Prefers open-ended challenges over step-by-step ("just tell me what to build, not how")
- Responds well to "try it and see what happens" — builds confidence

## Session Continuity
3/6 labs done (navigation, file-operations, text-processing). Text-processing went smoothly except
pipelines took two attempts. Ready for find-files next.

## Flags
- WATCH: Redirect confusion (> vs >>) — try side-by-side demonstration next time
