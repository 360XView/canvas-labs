# Session: Shell Navigation
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Duration:** ~18min
**Outcome:** Completed

## What Happened
Alice completed the shell-navigation lab on her first attempt. Fast on absolute paths and
ls, needed hints for relative path shortcuts (.. and ~).

## Observations
- Jumps into tasks immediately — didn't read the introduction before trying navigate-absolute.
  This worked fine because she already had some intuition about `cd`.
- Strong on absolute paths — no hesitation, correct first try.
- Relative paths tripped her up — specifically the `..` shortcut. Used 2 hints.
  After the hint explained `..` = "parent directory", she got it and used it correctly after.
- Aced the path quiz — good conceptual understanding even where practical execution needed help.

## What Worked
- Letting her try first before explaining worked well — she's an explorer.
- The hint about `..` = "parent directory" analogy clicked.

## Flags
- WATCH: Relative path shortcuts (.. and ~) — needed hints. Check if this sticks in file-operations.
