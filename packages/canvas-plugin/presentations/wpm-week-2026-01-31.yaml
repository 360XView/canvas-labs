        # The Agent Team

        **WPM** - Work Process Manager
        → Maintains repo health, enforces structure

        **Architect** - Software Architecture
        → Primary thinking partner, even for business ideas

        **PM** - Product Manager
        → Feature planning and roadmap

        **EvalLead** - Evaluation Lead
        → System-level testing and evaluation

        # Emerging Patterns

        **Architect → Plan → Coder**
        The most productive flow: think with Architect,
        document the plan, hand to Coder for implementation.

        **TUI as Universal Format**
        Interactive presentations work for:
        - Demos and tutorials
        - Tool creation (log viewer)
        - Team communication

        **Skills as Capabilities**
        Skills define what each agent can do.
        Shared skills (in ~/.claude/skills/) work for all.

        # Questions to Explore

        **Agent Communication**
        - Can Coder invoke EvalLead tools as sub-agent?
        - How do agents discover each other's capabilities?
        - Better handoff than copy-paste plans?

        **Boundaries**
        - Coder needs verification tools (unit tests)
        - EvalLead is for system-level evals
        - Where's the line?

        # Next Steps

        1. **Daily reflections** - Don't skip, even quick ones
        2. **Sub-agent exploration** - Can agents call each other?
        3. **Plan sharing** - Better handoff mechanisms
        4. **Business ideas** - Keep exploring with Architect
