        Welcome to Shell Navigation Fundamentals!

        The shell is your command-line interface to the computer. Before you can do
        anything useful, you need to know how to move around the filesystem.

        In this lab, you'll learn:
        - How to navigate using absolute and relative paths
        - Essential commands: cd, pwd, ls
        - Special directory shortcuts: . (current), .. (parent), ~ (home)

        Complete each task in the terminal below. The lab will detect your progress.

  - id: navigate-absolute
    title: Navigate with Absolute Paths
    type: task
    content:
      instructions: |
        An **absolute path** starts from the root directory (/) and specifies
        the complete path to a location.

        Navigate to the /etc directory using an absolute path.
      tasks:
        - text: Change directory to /etc using an absolute path
    hints:
      - id: hint-1
        text: "Use the cd command followed by the path"
      - id: hint-2
        text: "Absolute paths start with /"
      - id: hint-3
        text: "Type: cd /etc"
    solution:
      command: cd /etc
      explanation: The cd command changes your current directory. /etc is where system configuration files live.
    validation:
      type: command-pattern
      pattern: "cd\\s+/etc"

  - id: navigate-relative
    title: Navigate with Relative Paths
    type: task
    content:
      instructions: |
        A **relative path** is relative to your current location.

        - `.` means "current directory"
        - `..` means "parent directory"

        From /etc, navigate up one directory to the root (/), then go to /home.
      tasks:
        - text: Go up one directory using ..
        - text: Then navigate to /home
    hints:
      - id: hint-1
        text: ".. takes you to the parent directory"
      - id: hint-2
        text: "You can chain: cd ../home or do it in two steps"
      - id: hint-3
        text: "Try: cd .. then cd home, or cd ../home"
    solution:
      command: cd ../home
      explanation: "From /etc, .. goes to /, then home enters the /home directory"
    validation:
      type: command-pattern
      pattern: "cd\\s+(\\.\\./home|/home)"

  - id: home-shortcut
    title: Use Home Directory Shortcut
    type: task
    content:
      instructions: |
        The tilde character `~` is a shortcut for your home directory.

        Instead of typing the full path like /home/student, you can just use ~.

        Navigate to your home directory using the ~ shortcut.
      tasks:
        - text: Use ~ to go to your home directory
    hints:
      - id: hint-1
        text: "~ expands to your home directory path"
      - id: hint-2
        text: "Type: cd ~"
    solution:
      command: cd ~
      explanation: "~ expands to your home directory (e.g., /home/student)"
    validation:
      type: command-pattern
      pattern: "cd\\s+~"

  - id: list-files
    title: List Directory Contents
    type: task
    content:
      instructions: |
        The `ls` command lists directory contents.

        Useful flags:
        - `-l` for detailed (long) listing
        - `-a` to show hidden files (starting with .)
        - `-la` combines both

        List all files in /var/log, including hidden files.
      tasks:
        - text: List all files in /var/log including hidden files
    hints:
      - id: hint-1
        text: "-a shows hidden files (those starting with .)"
      - id: hint-2
        text: "You can specify a directory path after the flags"
      - id: hint-3
        text: "Try: ls -a /var/log"
    solution:
      command: ls -a /var/log
      explanation: "-a shows all files including hidden ones. You can also use -la for a detailed listing."
    validation:
      type: command-pattern
      pattern: "ls\\s+(-la|-al|-a)\\s+/var/log"

  - id: path-quiz
    title: Path Knowledge Check
    type: question
    content:
      question:
        text: "What does the path ../../home/student mean?"
        type: single
        options:
          - id: opt-correct
            text: "Go up two directories, then into home, then student"
            correct: true
            feedback: "Correct! Each .. goes up one directory level."
          - id: opt-wrong-1
            text: "Go to root, then home, then student"
            correct: false
            feedback: "Not quite. ../.. goes up two levels from current location, not to root."
          - id: opt-wrong-2
            text: "Go to the current directory twice"
            correct: false
            feedback: "No, . is current directory, .. is parent directory."
        explanation: |
          ../.. means "go up two directory levels." The path is relative to
          where you currently are. From /etc/apt, ../../home/student would
          go to /etc (first ..), then / (second ..), then into home/student.

        Excellent! You've mastered shell navigation fundamentals.

        Key takeaways:
        - `cd` changes directory
        - `pwd` shows current directory (try it anytime!)
        - `ls` lists files (-a for hidden, -l for details)
        - Absolute paths start with /
        - Relative paths are relative to current location
        - `..` goes up one level, `~` is your home directory
