        Welcome to Python Fundamentals!

        In this hands-on lab, you'll learn the basics of Python programming:
        - Writing functions
        - Using parameters and return values
        - String formatting with f-strings
        - Running tests to validate your code

        You'll use VS Code to edit Python files and watch tests run automatically as you save.

        Complete each task to progress through the lab.

  - id: hello-world
    title: Print Hello World
    type: task
    content:
      instructions: |
        Write a function called `hello()` that returns the string "Hello, World!".

        This is your first Python function. It takes no parameters and simply returns a greeting.
      tasks:
        - text: Define the hello() function that returns "Hello, World!"
    hints:
      - "Start with: def hello():"
      - "Use the return statement to send back a string"
      - "The string should be exactly: Hello, World!"
    solution:
      file: solutions/main.py
      range: "1-2"
    validation:
      type: pytest
      test: tests/test_main.py::test_hello_world

  - id: greet-name
    title: Greet by Name
    type: task
    content:
      instructions: |
        Write a function called `greet(name)` that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting.

        For example:
        - greet("Alice") should return "Hello, Alice!"
        - greet("Bob") should return "Hello, Bob!"

        Use an f-string to format the greeting with the provided name.
      tasks:
        - text: Define the greet(name) function using an f-string
    hints:
      - "Start with: def greet(name):"
      - "F-strings allow you to embed variables: f'text {variable}'"
      - "The format should be: Hello, {name}!"
    solution:
      file: solutions/main.py
      range: "4-5"
    validation:
      type: pytest
      test: tests/test_main.py::test_greet
